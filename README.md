Bonepill 2.0 based on ANSUR II

Yeah I'm gonna be honest I'm kinda shit at coding so don't expect good things here

Things I'm gonna try to add:

-Everything from anthro.cs

-Ability to see how many SDs you are from the median 

-Support for Imperial (I hate americans but I think it would be cool)

-Passoid detector (checks how far from the median you are in a series of ratios and raw measurements)
